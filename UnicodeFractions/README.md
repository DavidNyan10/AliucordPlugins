An Alliucord Port of [Powercord Unicode Fractions](https://github.com/DavidNyan10/UnicodeFractions/)

# Unicode Fractions

A plugin made for Alliucord. Create Unicode fractions with any numerator and denominator.

### Description

This is a simple Alliucord plugin designed to create Unicode fractions. There is only a few fractions built-in to the Unicode standard, which are very limited. This plugin will automatically create fractions using superscript & subscript characters.

Most maths stuff is taken from random codes in stackoverflow.

If you have any suggestions/ideas, feel free to create an issue, or ping/dm me in Discord (DavidNyan10#8581). Pull requests are very much appreciated.

Also, this is brand new and is my very first Alliucord plugin, so it might have a few bugs here and there (Nothing seems broken as of right now tho). Feel free to make suggestions and PRs. And not all of the symbols are superscriptable/subscriptable, there are some that I didn't see/didn't know existed. If you see them, feel free to fix them.
